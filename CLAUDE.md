# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a robust web application specifically designed to extract complete profile data from rip.fun user pages with intelligent username-to-ID resolution powered by blockchain integration. The app features comprehensive username bridging through Alchemy-powered Base network scanning, fetches HTML from rip.fun profiles with enhanced reliability features, parses the SvelteKit data structure from JavaScript code, automatically removes clip_embedding data to reduce payload size, and provides clean JSON output with comprehensive visualization of profile information, digital cards, packs, and collection statistics.

### Key Workflows

1. **Smart Input Resolution**: User provides either a rip.fun username (with autocomplete) or numeric user ID, system automatically resolves to appropriate extraction target
2. **Enhanced Data Extraction**: Backend fetches rip.fun profile HTML with automatic retries and progressive timeouts
   - Real-time progress updates to user during long extractions
   - Automatic retry on timeout/network errors with exponential backoff
   - Detailed error messages with troubleshooting guidance
3. **Data Processing**: Parses complete SvelteKit data structure with pack status analysis
   - Groups packs by name/type for organized display
   - Calculates opened, sealed, and pending open counts
   - Preserves all relevant data while removing clip_embedding bloat
4. **Advanced Visualization**: Interactive display with comprehensive card and pack management
   - **Card Filtering**: Set-based filtering with dropdown selection and card count display
   - **Missing Cards Integration**: Show missing cards with marketplace data, available only filtering, and buy now functionality
   - **Smart Deduplication**: Automatic card deduplication (always active, no toggle)
   - **Dual View Modes**: Grid view for visual browsing and table view with marketplace columns
   - **Smart Set Recognition**: Automatic parsing of set names from API data (e.g., "151", "Prismatic Evolutions")
   - **Marketplace Data**: Listed prices, availability status, buy now/make offer buttons for missing cards
   - **Collapsible Pack Groups**: Summary statistics with expandable detailed views
   - **Interactive Tables**: Enhanced tables with marketplace columns (Listed Price, Available, Action)
   - **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded status badges, availability icons (‚úÖ/‚ùå), and marketplace integration
   - **Cache Status**: Visual indicators showing data source (üì¶ Cached vs üåê Live)
5. **Data Export**: Provides complete JSON output with profile, cards, packs, and statistics

## Security Considerations

- All fetched HTML and JSON must be sanitized to prevent XSS/injection
- Input validation and normalization for user profile data
- Secure rip.fun URL construction and validation
- HTTPS-only communication with rip.fun

## Data Processing Notes

### SvelteKit Data Extraction
- Target: `<script type="application/json" data-sveltekit-fetched>` elements
- Multiple script blocks may exist and need combining
- JSON parsing required for embedded data

### Data Cleaning and Normalization Pipeline
- Automatically remove clip_embedding from digital_cards and cards arrays
- Remove unused/irrelevant keys (including clip_embedding references)
- Convert date strings to standard format
- Flatten nested objects to key-value pairs
- Deduplicate arrays and strip empty values
- Handle field mapping between rip.fun data structure and profile schema

### Advanced Card Filtering and Display System
- **Set-Based Organization**: Automatically group cards by Pokemon TCG sets using API-provided set data
- **Smart Set Name Parsing**: Extract human-readable set names from `card.set.name` field (e.g., "151", "Prismatic Evolutions", "Black Bolt")
- **Missing Cards Integration**: Complete marketplace integration with listing data and purchase options
  - **Show Missing Cards**: Display missing cards alongside owned cards with red styling
  - **Only Missing Cards**: Filter to show only missing cards from selected sets
  - **Available Only**: Show only missing cards that have active marketplace listings
- **Smart Deduplication**: Always-active intelligent deduplication (no user toggle required)
- **Dual View Modes**: 
  - **Grid View**: Visual card layout with images, stats, and missing cards indicators
  - **Table View**: Comprehensive data table with marketplace columns (Card, Set, Rarity, Type, Value, Listed Price, Available, Action, Status)
- **Marketplace Columns**:
  - **Listed Price**: Lowest available price for missing cards
  - **Available**: ‚úÖ/‚ùå icons showing listing availability
  - **Action**: Buy Now (blue) or Make Offer (gray) buttons linking to rip.fun
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Real-time filter updates with card count display for each set
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation to set_id display when set names are unavailable

### Pack Grouping and Status Analysis
- Group digital_products by name to consolidate similar pack types
- Analyze `open_status` field to categorize packs:
  - **Opened**: status contains "opened" 
  - **Sealed**: status contains "sealed", "unopened", or default for owned packs
  - **Pending Open**: status contains "pending" or "opening"
- Calculate summary statistics for each pack group
- Preserve individual pack details while providing grouped overview

### Enhanced Fetcher Configuration
- **Initial Timeout**: 20 seconds for first attempt
- **Maximum Timeout**: 60 seconds for final retry attempts  
- **Retry Logic**: Up to 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- **Browser Headers**: Realistic User-Agent and headers to avoid blocking
- **Error Classification**: Distinguish temporary vs permanent failures for smart retry logic
